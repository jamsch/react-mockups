# react-web-with-vite

A simple example showing how to use `react-mockups` with dynamic routing.

To get started:

```sh
$ yarn install / npm install
$ npm run mockup # Run the app in an isolated mockup view (loads index_mockup.tsx instead of index.tsx)
$ npm start # Run the regular Vite app
```

Open up <http://localhost:3000> to visit the mockup app. To control navigation between mockups you can either visit:

- http://localhost:1337
- or install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jamsch.react-native-mockups-explorer-vscode)
